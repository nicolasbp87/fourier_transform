The file “Peg_chewing_raw_electromyograms.csv” contains a collection of 144 raw electromyograms (time-domain signals) sampled at 1kHz. 

The electromyograms were acquired from the right-masseter muscles of 6 volunteers, who provided recordings at 3 separate sessions.  

At each session, they were asked to “chew” a wooden peg held between their incisors, in a prescribed manner, that is, in time with a metronome operating at a range of different beats-per-minute.

The wooden pegs were of a standard type, with known, measured mechanical characteristics. 

At each session, each volunteer provided duplicate recordings at 4 different prescribed rates (30, 60, 90 and 120bpm). 

Hence the total number of electromyograms = 3sessions x 6volunteers x 4rates x 2replicates = 144.

The data are described in full in the journal paper “Electromyographic responses to prescribed mastication ” (E. K. Kemsley, M. Defernez, J. C. Sprunt and A. C. Smith,  Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 2003, 13, 2, 197-207).
