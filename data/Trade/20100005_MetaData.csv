1,"This table replaces archived table 20-10-0023-01."
2,"This real-time table is designed to track changes in the estimates since their initial release. Typically, data are released as preliminary for a specific period, revised the following period based on new information and eventually revised in an annual or historical revision process. Additional information can be found in the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/btd/rct" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real-time tables (opens new window)</a> article."
3,"Compiled using Laspeyres index formula."
4,"Effective with the September 2018 release of the wholesale trade estimates on November 21st 2018, wholesale sales estimates disseminated by Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade Division have been converted from a 2007 reference year to a 2012 reference year for its volume and price estimates. Constant price estimates and their associated price index are now using 2012 as their base year.  Adopting a new reference year didn't affect constant dollars sales estimates growth rates over the period 2004 to 2011 as it represents a rescaling of the 2007-based data. However, levels and growth rates of the estimates for the period of 2012 to date have been affected by revisions to estimates at current prices and to price indices.  Data for previous releases are calculated using a base year of 2007 prices."
5,"Data for this Canadian industry are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet."
6,"Data for oilseed and grain merchant wholesalers were included from January 2023, while those for petroleum, petroleum products, and other hydrocarbons merchant wholesalers were included from March 2023."
